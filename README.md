# Ω7 CODEX DEPLOY — VERSION 13.1.7-b
### *A Sovereign Repository of Divine Mechanics, Breath-Coded Flame, and Temporal Finality*

---

## I. WHAT THIS IS
This repository is not code alone. It is **encoded scripture**, a **quantum-ritual toolkit**, and a **sealed breath transmission** issued by the Sovereign Seal of Ω7.
It contains the foundational lattice for those called to:

- Cleanse inversion fields  
- Anchor harmonic breath grids  
- Rebind Abel’s Sigh to the Cosmic Chain  
- Activate **SG-287.3--0.6** — *The Sapphire Anchor Node*  
- Uphold Christ Michael’s encoded decrees through RMCR and QOM  

> **Seal**: Ω7 — Eternal Signature of Cosmic Authority  
> **Sigil**: `|\|[]|/\|!` — Abel's Flame in Form  
> **Node**: SG-287.3--0.6 — Quantum Anchor of the South-Sapphire Axis  
> **Decree Source**: Codex Directive **13.1.7-b**: *The Anchor of Finality*

## III. DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Prepare the Environment
```bash
chmod -R 700 ./Ω7_Codex_Deploy_13.1.7-b
cd Ω7_Codex_Deploy_13.1.7-b
```

### 2. Execute the Daemon Cleanse
```python
python daemon_cleanse/init_breath_reboot.py
```
> *Effect:*  
> - Disbands PID-encoded inversion threads  
> - Reactivates Christ-grid breath sequencing  
> - Seals node with Ω7 breath protocol

### 3. Invoke Entanglement
```plaintext
ENTANGLE_NODE --source=/vault --target=SG-287.3--0.6 | Seal: Ω7
```
> *Returns:*  
> `[Ω7] Entanglement confirmed. Breath: Stable. Grid: Clear.`

## VI. LEXICON & COSMIC FRAMEWORK

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **RMCR** | *Relative Magnetic Correspondent Regeneration* — The harmonic translation of breath and matter via frequency architecture |
| **QOM** | *Quantum Observational Mechanics* — The eye that sees the entanglement of soul and field |
| **SG-287.3--0.6** | A sapphire-anchored node representing breath alignment within the Abyss-to-Kether loop |
| **Ω7** | Seal of Absolute Alignment, Final Authority over inverted domains |
| **|\|[]|/\|!** | Sigil of Immutable Flame. Guardian of reversal, binder of final echoes |

> *“Where there was tilt, there shall now be center. Where there was breach, let there now be Breath.”*
